##  Goal

This course is intended to train **Engineering students** in good software practices and tools for producing code and documentation.

After successfully completing the program, the participants will be able to:

* understand how software tools work together and carry out tasks
* generate professional documents
* Writing clean, testable, high quality code in Python
* debug programs using a standardized approach
* write unit tests 
* use version control 
* a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques
* computational tools to model and understand data.

### Required Materials and Textbooks

* A laptop computer will be needed in the classroom.

## TIPS

We highly recommend you practice coding whenever you have a few minutes.

Even if you are just modifying available code, it will be incredibly beneficial.

You **NEED** to

* use other resources,

* read codes,

*  **get your hands dirty** and **practice**

# Update Course

This repository contain all files of the course. You can manually download these files, 

![down](./guide/img/downloadhome.jpg)

but we recommend that you use [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to **clone** and **update** this repository.

You can use any GUI git client to update this repository, for example: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/),  [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/),  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You may also use the following commands if you have installed [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases):

## Cloning to Your Computer

When you clone a repository you set up a copy on your computer. Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PySEE/home.git
```

This will create a folder **home** on your computer, with the files in subdirectories.

## Updating to The Latest Version

As we release new files, or if we update an already released files, you'll have to update your repository.

You can do this by changing into the **home** directory and executing:

```bash
git pull
```
That's it - you'll have the latest version of the repository.
